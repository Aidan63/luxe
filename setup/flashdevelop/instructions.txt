To use the flash develop template,

1) Close FD
2) copy this folder to your FlashDevelop\Projects\ folder, it should be alongside the OpenFL and other project templates.
3) Open FD, Project -> New Project -> Luxe Project (under haxe projects)
4) choose your folder destination and name
5) When it opens, if 'references' is not showing a + to expand, File -> Restart from the main FD menu
6) Make sure you pick Neko/C++/HTML5/android as a target, as the default (flash) will not work.

That should be it, then code complete, and builds should work!
